Hi there! I'm **Rusydy**, a passionate software engineer from the vibrant city of Jakarta, Indonesia. Welcome to my little corner of the internet where I share my journey, experiences, and thoughts on technology, coding, and life in general.

## My Journey

Ever since I was a kid, I've been fascinated by how things work. This curiosity led me to pursue a career in software engineering, where I get to solve complex problems and create innovative solutions every day.

### Professional Life

Currently, I'm working as a Software Engineer at [PT Mid Solusi Nusantara - Mekari](https://mekari.com/). My role involves enhancing and maintaining our accounting software, and it's a challenging yet rewarding experience that keeps me on my toes.

Before joining Mekari, I had the opportunity to work with some amazing teams at [Koinworks](https://koinworks.com/) and [SF Group](https://sfund.id/). These experiences have shaped my skills and provided me with a deep understanding of software development.

### Freelance Adventures

In addition to my full-time roles, I've also enjoyed working as a freelance software engineer. This has allowed me to collaborate with diverse clients and projects, ranging from creating APIs and databases to developing mobile apps and web applications. Each project has been a unique learning experience, and I cherish the flexibility and creativity that freelancing offers.

### Teaching and Mentoring

Before diving into the tech world, I spent some time as an English teacher. Teaching has always been close to my heart, and it was incredibly fulfilling to help students improve their language skills and achieve their goals. This experience has also made me a better communicator and mentor in my current role.
