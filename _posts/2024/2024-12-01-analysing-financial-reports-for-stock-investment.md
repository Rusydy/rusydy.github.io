## **Understanding Fundamental Analysis**

At its core, fundamental analysis is about identifying companies with:

- Strong business models.
- Competent management.
- Fairly priced or undervalued stocks.

The primary data source for this analysis is the company’s **annual report** and **audited financial statements**. These documents are comprehensive, verified by public accountants, and provide the most reliable insight into a company's operations. However, due to their formal and extensive nature, it can be challenging to know where to start.

## **Key Points to Examine in Financial Reports**

We’ve broken down the analysis into **eight essential points** to simplify the process:

### **A. Company Profile and Business Model**

Before investing, understand the company’s history, business operations, and leadership team. Look for:

- **Business history:** For instance, SIDO Muncul began as a home-based business in 1930 and has diversified its operations.
- **Leadership quality:** Check the credentials and reputation of board members, directors, and shareholders.

This information is often available in the **company profile** section of the annual report.

### **B. Industry and Economic Factors**

Evaluate external and internal factors that impact the company’s industry, such as:

- Market trends.
- Interest rates.
- Regional developments.

For example, a property business is influenced by land prices, interest rates, and urban development. This information is generally found in the **Management Discussion and Analysis** section.

### **C. Auditor and Audit Opinion**

Examine who audited the financial statements and their opinion. Reputable auditors include PwC, EY, and KPMG. Audit opinions fall into four categories:

1. **Unqualified Opinion:** Best rating, indicates compliance with accounting standards.
2. **Qualified Opinion:** Some issues exist but are not critical.
3. **Adverse Opinion:** Major non-compliance with standards.
4. **Disclaimer of Opinion:** Auditor lacks sufficient evidence for an opinion.

### **D. Profit and Loss Statement**

Analyse the income statement to check:

- Profitability: Compare this year’s profit with previous years.
- **Profit margin:** Higher margins indicate efficient management.

Visualised data, such as charts in investment apps like Ajaib, can simplify understanding.

### **E. Revenue and Expense Sources**

Investigate whether revenue comes from core business activities or one-off sources like asset sales. For example, in 2018, a company reported high profits due to contractual income rather than operational performance.

### **F. Business Partners**

Identify business partners and check if transactions are genuine or manipulated within affiliated companies. A 2017 case revealed sales recorded as external but were made within the same ownership group.

### **G. Revenue Quality**

Large-scale businesses often generate revenue on a credit basis. Verify that operational profit aligns with **cash flow from operations**, as discrepancies can indicate potential issues.

### **H. Liquidity**

Liquidity measures a company’s ability to meet short-term obligations. Use the **current ratio**:
current_ratio = current_assets / current_liabilities

A ratio above 1 indicates sufficient liquidity to cover short-term debts.

## **3. Practical Tips for Analysing Financial Reports**

- **Download Reports:** Use tools like Ajaib’s calendar feature to access financial reports.
- **Start with Key Sections:** Focus on profiles, auditor opinions, and financial highlights first.
- **Cross-Verify Data:** Supplement company data with independent sources for balanced insights.

## **Final Thoughts**

Analysing financial reports may seem overwhelming initially, but by breaking it down into these eight points, you’ll gain clarity on a company’s true financial health. Remember, while this process is essential for making informed decisions, no single method guarantees success. Diversify your strategies and keep learning.
