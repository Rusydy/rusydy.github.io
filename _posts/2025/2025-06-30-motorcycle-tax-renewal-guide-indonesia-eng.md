Renewing your motorcycle's annual tax is a mandatory obligation for every vehicle owner. To ensure the process runs smoothly without back-and-forth trips, it's essential to prepare everything properly. Here's a clear and easy-to-follow step-by-step guide based on general procedures at Samsat buildings. As of 2025, this guide still remains relevant, eventhough some procedures are claim to be online, but in reality, many Samsat offices still require in-person visits.

This guide conducted in Jakarta, Indonesia, and the procedures might slightly vary in different regions, but the overall flow should be similar. **Be aware of possible changes in procedures due to updates in regulations or office policies, or corruption/bribery practices that might affect the process.**

### Stage 1: Document Preparation & Form Collection

The first step is ensuring all required documents are complete. This is key to preventing any delays in your process.

**Required Documents to Bring:**

- **Original ID Card (KTP)** and 1 photocopy.
- **Original STNK** (Vehicle Registration Certificate) and 1 photocopy.
- **Original BPKB** (Vehicle Ownership Document) and 1 photocopy (for some Samsat offices or specific conditions, BPKB photocopy might be required, so it's better to prepare it just in case).
- **TBPKP (Tax Payment Proof)** or previous year's tax receipt if available.

**Process on 2nd Floor (1-Year Tax Validation):**

1.  **Go to 2nd Floor** of the Samsat Building.
2.  **Get SKP Form** (Tax Assessment Letter). Usually available at the information counter or designated desk.
3.  **Fill out the Form** with data matching your STNK.
4.  **Register at SKP Counter**. Submit the completed form along with photocopies of ID card, STNK, and last year's TBPKP/Tax Receipt.

### Stage 2: Payment at Cashier

After your documents are verified, the next step is making the payment.

1.  **Wait for Your Call**. The officer will call your name according to the data on your STNK.
2.  **Go to Jasa Raharja Counter & Cashier**. After being called, you'll receive an SKP (Tax Assessment Letter) containing the breakdown of total tax to be paid.
3.  **Make Payment** at the designated cashier counter. Keep the payment receipt safe.

### Stage 3: Collection of Validated STNK

This is the final step in the annual tax renewal process.

1.  **Wait for Final Call**. After payment, wait again in front of the STNK delivery counter.
2.  **Collect New STNK**. Your name will be called to collect the validated STNK (usually in the form of a validation stamp on the STNK sheet) along with the new TBPKP or new tax payment proof.
3.  **Done!** Make sure you receive the original STNK and new TBPKP before leaving Samsat.

### Important Notes

- **Arrive Early**. To avoid long queues, try to come in the morning.
- **Bring Your Own Writing Tools**. Bringing your own pen will speed up the form-filling process.
- **Double-check All Documents**. Before leaving home, ensure no documents are left behind.
- **Procedures May Vary Slightly**. Floor order or counter arrangements might vary at each Samsat office, but the general process flow will be the same.

Hope this guide helps you renew your motorcycle's annual tax more easily and quickly!
