Pros:

1. I don’t have to know my neighbours. If anything happens, like a noisy neighbour or a car parked in front of my property, I can just ask the security.
2. Nobody will block the street for a hajatan or a married party.
3. The security patrol is available 24/7, so I can rest assured that my property is safe.
4. The suburbs are much quieter compared to the city.
5. There’s a dedicated garbage collector, so I don’t have to worry about people burning their garbage in residential areas.
6. If I’m not home, I can ask the security for help if my packages arrive.

Cons:

1. It’s not well integrated with the public transportation network, so I have to travel further for high-end restaurants, shopping, and entertainment, which are more concentrated in the city.
